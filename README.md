## Description

Thanks to advancements of modern technology, we are ever reliant on having WiFi access. In the times that the WiFi signal is weak or unavailable, it's important that our most vital applications have some form of offline capabilities. This project aims at creating a progressive web application(PWA) in the form of a note-taker/ text-editor to have portable notebook wherever you go. This note-taker / text-editor has offline capabilities that will save your notes or code snippets in a local database and will display those notes created upon opening or refresh until the user deletes the note/text.

A link to the deployed application can be found [here](https://warm-spire-99580-61e0bdcb56b4.herokuapp.com/)
